The information on the IEEE 24-bus and 118-bus systems, and the wind power data. The wind data for the 24-bus system comes from the paper: Arrigo A, Kazempour J, De Gr√®ve Z, et al. Embedding dependencies between wind farms in distributionally robust optimal power flow[J]. IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 2022, 38(6): 5156-5169. The wind data for the 118-bus system comes from Monte Carlo simulations.
